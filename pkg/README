Just a few examples.
For each directory progdir/, see README for specific information.
The version info and such will be in progdir/support/ and the program source
should be placed in progdir/src/, though it is omitted from this repo.

The normal use case for building and installing is:
  sudo trip -b progdir
  sudo trip -i NAME-VERSION-ARCH.tar.gz

Listing packages and uninstalling is:
  trip -l
  sudo trip -u NAME-VERSION-ARCH.tar.gz
