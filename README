Pierre Hebert is awesome for making trip.

This isn't really a proper fork, but I modified the TRIvial Package manager to
work better for me.

Here's how you install (also see NOTES below):
$  sudo make install
$  cp -r dot-trip ~/.trip

Then, the quick way to install packages and such:
$  trip-skel.sh <progname> <version>  <source>
$  sudo trip -b <progname>-<version>
$  sudo trip -i <progname>-<version>-<arch>.tar.gz

For example, today I did this exactly:
$  cd ~/packaging/apvlv
$  trip-skel.sh apvlv 0.0.9.6 ~/dldir/apvlv-0.0.9.6.tar.gz
Uninstall previous versions before building, else you won't get the files
which overlap on install.
$  sudo trip -u apvlv-0.0.9.5-x86_64
$  sudo trip -u apvlv-doc-0.0.9.5-x86_64
Build
$  sudo trip -b apvlv-0.0.9.6
Install
$  sudo trip -i apvlv-0.0.9.6-x86_64.tar.gz
$  sudo trip -i apvlv-doc-0.0.9.6-x86_64.tar.gz

NOTES:
Some things don't work. Simple stuff does, since I use this as a replacement
  for stow. I'd like to fix some when summer (2010) hits.
Your kernel must support unionfs or aufs.
  With aufs though, you cannot have a file residing on the root partition to
  mount via loopback to TRIP_FS_PKG. It's a useful technique on low memory
  systems.
The sample config (in dot-trip/conf, or ~/.trip/conf after installation)
  mounts TRIP_FS_PKG as shared memory (like /dev/shm).
  Since the package is actually installed to that mountpoint, if you don't
  have much RAM, or are installing a proportionally large package, you may
  want to change this.

Please bug me, Alex Klinkhamer @ (com.gmail::grencez) about relevant stuff.
